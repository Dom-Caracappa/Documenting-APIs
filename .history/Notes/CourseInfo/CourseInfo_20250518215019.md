## From Practice to Documentation 

This course provides hands-on experience from the API Developer point of view before shifting into how a technical writer documents API endpoints and other REST API topics. Discussion is given to each element a technical writer must reference with REST API documentation:
- Resource descriptions
- Endpoints and methods
- Parameters
- Request example
- Response example

Discussion on conceptual matters surrounding API documentation such as how to get started, how to perform a product overview, how to document status and error codes, how to request autorizatuion, etc..
